# MIC: Masked Image Consistency for Context-Enhanced Domain Adaptation

## MIC for Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation

You can find the source code to run MIC on domain-adaptive semantic segmentation
in the subfolder [seg/](seg/). For instructions how to set up the environment/datasets and how
to train MIC for semantic segmentation UDA, please refer to [seg/README.md](seg/README.md).

We recommend starting with MIC for semantic segmentation as it implements the full set
of configurations as well as the ablation studies.
